# introtoai-logic_engine
Logic Engine Program Done in Collaboration with a Partner

Features / Bugs / Missing:
Features:
-	The program can perform the tasks:
o	User can enter in their text file and method they would like to use with the inference engine. This may include BC, FC and TT
o	Forward Chaining
o	Backward Chaining
o	Truth Table (To some Extent)
o	The result of the desired method will print out for the user once the job is done by the program
Bugs:
-	During the test stage most cases worked when using the desired method of choice when using the inference engine program
-	The Truth Table class was a little buggy when using a test file document
-	From the best of our knowledge the program works to the best of our abilities
Missing:
-	There are no missing attempts as every requirement has been attempted for this assessment.
